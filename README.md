## Possibility to improve

For such a small app and taking into consideration that it's a testing app, I've just used hooks for state management.
I'd use mobx/redux or even [Effector](https://github.com/zerobias/effector) ðŸ˜‰ in prod.

There is some unoptimised boilerplate code in tests, which ofc could be abstracted away.
